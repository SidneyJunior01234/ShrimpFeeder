audio:
  # Default sample rate (Hz) used in common audio applications (e.g., music, speech).
  # Note: Shrimp detection typically uses higher sample rates (e.g., 96â€“192 kHz),
  # so this value may be overridden based on each WAV file's metadata.
  default_fs: 44100

processing:
  # Duration (in seconds) of each short-term analysis frame (used in STFT resolution)
  short_term_duration: 0.005

  # Duration (in seconds) of each mid-term window for sequential reading of audio data
  # This helps minimize reading gaps between consecutive audio chunks
  mid_term_duration: 1.0

detection:
  # Amplitude threshold for detecting click events (empirically selected)
  threshold: 0.01

  frequency_band:
    # Frequency range (in Hz) used by SF and HFC onset detection functions
    low: 5000
    high: 22000

aggregation:
  # Window size (in seconds) used to aggregate detected clicks (e.g., count per window)
  window_size: 60
